# Resume Improvement & Job Scraper Agent

An AI-powered full-stack application that scrapes job descriptions, analyzes resumes against job requirements, and provides intelligent, actionable resume improvement suggestions using natural language processing and agent-based reasoning.

This project is designed as a Resume Improvement Agent, helping users tailor their resumes to specific job roles and improve job-fit quality and to also find jobs that are suited to them according to their resume.

## Problem Statement

Job seekers often struggle to customize their resumes for individual job descriptions.  
Manual tailoring is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often leads to poor ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility, reducing interview opportunities.

## Solution Overview

The system automates resume tailoring by:
- Scraping job descriptions from online sources
- Parsing and analyzing resumes using NLP techniques
- Matching resume content against job requirements
- Generating improvement suggestions to enhance relevance and impact

---

## Key Features

- Automated job description scraping
- Resume parsing and semantic analysis
- AI-based resume–job matching
- Actionable resume improvement recommendations
- Modern web-based frontend
- Modular and scalable system design
